A wedding site on ``ReadTheDocs``??? "Functional and well-documented" is kind of our aesthetic.

Here are the important deets:

 * **When?** Evening of Saturday October 5, 2014. (Exact time TBD)

 * **Where?** `Crystal Ballroom <https://www.crystalballroomcatering.com/>`_ of the Lerner Theatre (410 S Main St, Elkhart, IN 46516).

 * **RSVP?** You got to this website from an email invitation; just follow the instructions on that email.

And some other deets:

 * **Registry?** We've already furnished an apartment together and don't need more stuff. Your presence is the only gift we need :D

 * **Food?** Indian-American fusion buffet (+ dessert bar). Mostly vegetarian, but there will also be chicken for those interested.
