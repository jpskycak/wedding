Getting Here
**********

Thank you for making the time to travel to our wedding :) We understand that it's not the easiest destination to get to. Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns.

* You can fly to the South Bend regional airport or to Midway or O'Hare airports in Chicago. 
\

* Chicago is approximately a 2 hour drive away. O'Hare airport has the most and cheapest flights.
\

* Depending on where you're coming from, it may be more convenient to take the train than to fly. The `Elkhart Amtrak station <https://www.amtrak.com/stations/ekh>`_ is only a 10 minute walk from the venue.
