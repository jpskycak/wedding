Getting Here
**********

Thank you for making the time to travel to our wedding :)

You can fly to the South Bend regional airport or to Midway or O'Hare airports in Chicago. 

Chicago is approximately a 2 hour drive from the Michiana (portmanteau of Michigan and Indiana) area. O'Hare airport has the most and cheapest flight options.

We strongly recommend renting a car because as it is the Midwest, a car is basically necessary for getting around.
