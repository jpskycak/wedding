Getting Here
**********

Thank you for making the time to travel to our wedding :) We understand that it's not the easiest destination to get to. Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns.

* You can fly to the South Bend regional airport or to Midway or O'Hare airports in Chicago. 
\

* Chicago is approximately a 2 hour drive away. O'Hare airport has the most and cheapest flights.
\

* Depending on where you're coming from, it may be more convenient to take the train than to fly. The `Elkhart Amtrak station <https://www.amtrak.com/stations/ekh>`_ is only a 10 minute walk from the venue.

Staying Here

* We have two hotel blocks: one in `Elkhart <https://bit.ly/elkhart-hotel>`_ next to the venue and another in `Mishawaka <https://bit.ly/mishawaka-hotel>`_, which is about a 20 minute drive to the venue.
