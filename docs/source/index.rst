Why is this site on *ReadTheDocs*? So that it's easy to read and navigate.

:sup:`("Useful and well-documented" is kind of our aesthetic. We even have a Slack org with just the two of us.)`

To keep the URL reasonably short, we used the portmanteau ``sanjustin = sanjana + justin``. Conveniently, *Sanju* is a diminutive of Sanjana.

.. (/lu'make/) is a Python library for cooks and food lovers
.. that creates recipes mixing random ingredients.
.. It pulls data from the `Open Food Facts database <https://world.openfoodfacts.org/>`_
.. and offers a *simple* and *intuitive* API.

.. Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
.. how to :ref:`installation` the project.

.. note::

   This site is just a template for now. We'll add more information later.
