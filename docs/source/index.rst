===================================

Why is this site on `ReadTheDocs`? Because we wanted to prioritize readability and navigability over aesthetics.
:sub:`(Okay, fine, it also matches our aesthetic.)`

To keep the URL reasonably short, we used the portmanteau ``SanJustin = Sanjana + Justin``. (*Sanju* is a diminutive of Sanjana.)

.. (/lu'make/) is a Python library for cooks and food lovers
.. that creates recipes mixing random ingredients.
.. It pulls data from the `Open Food Facts database <https://world.openfoodfacts.org/>`_
.. and offers a *simple* and *intuitive* API.

.. Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
.. how to :ref:`installation` the project.

   This site is just a template for now. We'll add more information later.
