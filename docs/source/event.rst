A wedding site on ``ReadTheDocs``??? "Functional and well-documented" is kind of our aesthetic.

Here are the important deets:

 * **When?** Evening of Saturday October 5, 2014.

   * Please arrive by 5:30pm. (We'll also be around for greeting/photos from 3-5pm.)

   * The ceremony will take place at 6pm, followed by dinner & reception around 7:30pm.

   * We ask that guests please make their way out by 10:30pm. (We'll need to clean up some stuff and check out of the venue by midnight.)
      
 * **Where?** `Crystal Ballroom <https://www.crystalballroomcatering.com/>`_ of the Lerner Theatre (410 S Main St, Elkhart, IN 46516).

 * **RSVP?** You got to this website from an email invitation; just follow the instructions on that email.

 * **Dress code?** Formal Indian or American, whatever you prefer. For instance, a collared shirt with a tie and/or jacket is fine. Additionally, any colors are fine -- even white (Sanjana will be wearing colorful Indian attire).

And some other deets:

 * **Registry?** We've already furnished an apartment together and don't need more stuff. Your presence is the only gift we need :D

 * **Food?** Indian & American fusion buffet (+ dessert bar). Mostly vegetarian, but there will also be chicken for those interested.

 * **Music?** A mixture of well-known Indian & American stuff.
